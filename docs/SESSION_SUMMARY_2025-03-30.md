# Session Summary - 2025-03-30

**Goal:** Set up the WeaveNet Hacker project and implement the basic Simulated OS shell.

**Initial Project Setup:**
1. **Project Creation & Analysis:**
   * Analyzed reference project: Windows XP simulator (https://websim.ai/@BookwormKevin/windows-xp-simulator)
   * Created project structure based on modern JavaScript practices
   * Set up Vite + Phaser 3 development environment

2. **Version Control Setup:**
   * Initialized Git repository
   * Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/chromewillow/WeaveNetHacker
   * Configured secure `.gitignore`:
     - Protected sensitive files (API keys, credentials)
     - Set up logging structure (`logs/important/`, `logs/errors/`)
     - Excluded development artifacts

3. **Project Structure:**
   ```
   WeaveNetHacker_Dev/
   ├── src/          # Source code
   ├── docs/         # Documentation
   ├── public/       # Static assets
   ├── logs/         # Logging directory
   └── [config files]
   ```

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1. **Context Preservation:**
   * Discussed how to retain insights from the Windows XP simulator analysis
   * Created a Cascade Memory (`aecf7b51-d888-4296-af3a-415bc4313e7a`) detailing the planned UI implementation strategy (Phaser Containers, WindowManager class)
   * Added a summary of the UI strategy to `GAME_CONCEPT.md`
   * Refined the first prototyping task in `TASKLIST.md` to be more specific about the `WindowManager`

2. **Development Server Verification:**
   * Successfully ran `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server
   * Confirmed the basic Phaser project was running via Browser Preview at `http://localhost:5173/`

3. **Basic OS Shell Implementation (Prototype Core Mechanic 1):**
   * Created `src/ui/WindowManager.js` with a basic class structure
   * Modified `src/scenes/Game.js`:
     - Set the scene background color (`#0a0a2a`)
     - Imported and instantiated the `WindowManager`
   * Implemented `WindowManager.createWindow()`:
     - Creates a `Phaser.Container` for the window
     - Adds basic visuals (background, title bar, placeholder close button, content area) using `Phaser.Graphics` and `Phaser.Text`
   * Implemented basic `WindowManager.bringToFront()` logic for depth sorting and visual feedback (alpha change)
   * Implemented `WindowManager.destroyWindow()` (basic cleanup, not yet called)
   * Added calls in `Game.js` to create two test windows

4. **Input Handling & Debugging:**
   * Initial dragging implementation using a separate `Zone` failed
   * Debugging steps:
     * Added console logs to drag handlers
     * Added global input listener to `Game.js`
     * Simplified implementation: Made the window `Container` itself directly interactive and draggable
   * **Result:** Clicking windows now brings them to the front, and dragging the windows works (though needs refinement)

**Code Changes:**

* **Created:**
  * `src/ui/WindowManager.js`
  * `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-03-30.md`
  * `README.md` with comprehensive project documentation
* **Modified:**
  * `docs/GAME_CONCEPT.md` (Added UI Strategy)
  * `docs/TASKLIST.md` (Updated task details and status)
  * `src/scenes/Game.js` (Set background, instantiate WindowManager, create test windows, add debug listener)
  * `src/ui/WindowManager.js` (Implemented window creation, dragging, focus, destroy logic)

**Next Steps:**

1. Refine window dragging (e.g., stop drag correctly, potentially constrain to screen bounds)
2. Implement the close button functionality by calling `destroyWindow`
3. Implement window resizing
4. Start building the actual Terminal UI component to place inside a window

**Technical Decisions:**
- Using Phaser 3 for the game engine
- Vite as the build tool
- ES6+ JavaScript for development
- Git/GitHub for version control

**Security Considerations:**
- Implemented secure `.gitignore` configuration
- Set up structured logging with sensitive data protection
- Prepared for proper credential management
