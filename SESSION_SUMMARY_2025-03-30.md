# Session Summary - 2025-03-30

**Goal:** Start implementing the basic Simulated OS shell based on the updated `GAME_CONCEPT.md` and `TASKLIST.md`.

**Key Activities & Outcomes:**

1.  **Context Preservation:**
    *   Discussed how to retain insights from the Windows XP simulator analysis.
    *   Created a Cascade Memory (`aecf7b51-d888-4296-af3a-415bc4313e7a`) detailing the planned UI implementation strategy (Phaser Containers, WindowManager class).
    *   Added a summary of the UI strategy to `GAME_CONCEPT.md`.
    *   Refined the first prototyping task in `TASKLIST.md` to be more specific about the `WindowManager`.

2.  **Development Server Verification:**
    *   Successfully ran `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.
    *   Confirmed the basic Phaser project was running via Browser Preview at `http://localhost:5173/`.

3.  **Basic OS Shell Implementation (Prototype Core Mechanic 1):**
    *   Created `src/ui/WindowManager.js` with a basic class structure.
    *   Modified `src/scenes/Game.js`:
        *   Set the scene background color (`#0a0a2a`).
        *   Imported and instantiated the `WindowManager`.
    *   Implemented `WindowManager.createWindow()`:
        *   Creates a `Phaser.Container` for the window.
        *   Adds basic visuals (background, title bar, placeholder close button, content area) using `Phaser.Graphics` and `Phaser.Text`.
    *   Implemented basic `WindowManager.bringToFront()` logic for depth sorting and visual feedback (alpha change).
    *   Implemented `WindowManager.destroyWindow()` (basic cleanup, not yet called).
    *   Added calls in `Game.js` to create two test windows.

4.  **Input Handling & Debugging:**
    *   Initial dragging implementation using a separate `Zone` failed.
    *   Debugging steps:
        *   Added console logs to drag handlers.
        *   Added global input listener to `Game.js`.
        *   Simplified implementation: Made the window `Container` itself directly interactive and draggable.
    *   **Result:** Clicking windows now brings them to the front, and dragging the windows works (though needs refinement).

**Code Changes:**

*   **Created:**
    *   `src/ui/WindowManager.js`
    *   `SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-03-30.md`
*   **Modified:**
    *   `GAME_CONCEPT.md` (Added UI Strategy)
    *   `TASKLIST.md` (Updated task details and status)
    *   `src/scenes/Game.js` (Set background, instantiate WindowManager, create test windows, add debug listener)
    *   `src/ui/WindowManager.js` (Implemented window creation, dragging, focus, destroy logic)

**Next Steps (When Resuming):**

1.  Refine window dragging (e.g., stop drag correctly, potentially constrain to screen bounds).
2.  Implement the close button functionality by calling `destroyWindow`.
3.  Implement window resizing.
4.  Start building the actual Terminal UI component to place inside a window.
